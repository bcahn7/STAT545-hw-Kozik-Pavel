# STAT545-hw01-Kozik-Pavel




I initially created the repository on github and began working on it there. 

In the follow up class R markdown was introduced and I from there made all changes and progress via R. Initially it was slightly confusing because I had never prior used R markdown. Eventually I was able to have things appear centered when examining them in R studio, but when uploading onto github, the resulting html file no longer offered this. I would like to learn how to better align items.


Something not included in the sample assignment was how to center text and images. This was something I experimented with until eventually finding a satisfactory solution.

This final  portion of the assignment was written via browser.
