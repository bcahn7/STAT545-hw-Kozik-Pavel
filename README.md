***Homework Introduction***

This repository was created by Pavel Kozik to complete the first [**STATS 545**](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) homework assignment.

I am a third year PhD student in cognitive psychology. During my free time I enjoy reading, and am currently reading the [**metamorphosis**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/485894.The_Metamorphosis) by Franz Kafka. I also enjoy climbing, running and rainy weather.

I initially created the repository on github and began working on it there. 

In the follow up class R markdown was introduced and I from there made all changes and progress via R. Initially it was slightly confusing because I had never prior used R markdown. Eventually I was able to have things appear centered when examining them in R studio, but when uploading onto github, the resulting html file no longer offered this. I would like to learn how to better align items.


Something not included in the sample assignment was how to center text and images. This was something I experimented with until eventually finding a satisfactory solution.

This final  portion of the assignment was written via browser.
