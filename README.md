<center>*Homework Introduction*</center>

This repository was created by Pavel Kozik to complete the first [**STATS 545**](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) homework assignment.

I am a third year PhD student in cognitive psychology. During my free time I enjoy reading, and am currently reading the [**metamorphosis**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/485894.The_Metamorphosis) by Franz Kafka.

#### I also enjoy

- climbing 
- running 
- and rainy weather.

I initially began this homework assignment via the github browser. Once the class was introduced to R markdown however, most of my changes came from there. I am intentionally alternating to try and be comfortable working both via browser and R. 

One issue I had was learning to center items. There were certain commands that when used in R studio would result in a centered image, but on github did not appear centered.
