# STAT545-hw01-Kozik-Pavel

I initially created the homework repository on github and began working there. 

In the follow up class R markdown was introduced and I from there made all changes and progress via R. Initially it was slightly confusing because I had never prior used R markdown. Eventually I was able to have things appear centered when examining them in R studio, but when uploading onto github, the resulting html file no longer offered this. I would like to learn how to better align items.

E.g. when using R and pressing knit the code "<center> <h3>GDP Across Continents</h3> </center>" creates centered text. However when pushing to github, the text is no longer centered. This was a bit confusing as I had been using the knit option as a preview of what I expected on github. 

Also, is there a benefit to using *italics* vs. <i> italics</i> and other like such commands.

This final  portion of the assignment was written via browser.
