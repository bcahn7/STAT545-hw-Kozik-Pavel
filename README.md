***Homework Introduction***

This repository was created by Pavel Kozik to complete the first [**STATS 545**](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) homework assignment.

I am a third year PhD student in cognitive psychology. During my free time I enjoy reading, and am currently reading the [**metamorphosis**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/485894.The_Metamorphosis) by Franz Kafka. I also enjoy climbing, running and rainy weather.

In the follow up class R markdown was introduced and I from there made all changes and progress via R. Initially it was slightly confusing because I had never prior used R markdown. Eventually I was able to have things appear centered when examining them in R studio, but when uploading onto github, the resulting html file no longer offered this. I would like to learn how to better align items.

E.g. when using R and pressing knit the code "<center> <h3>GDP Across Continents</h3> </center>" creates centered text. However when pushing to github, the text is no longer centered. This was a bit confusing as I had been using the knit option as a preview of what I expected on github. 

Also, is there a benefit to using asterisk created *italics* vs. bracket created <i> italics</i> and other commands in which both R studio and html can produce a similar outcome.

This final  portion of the assignment was written via browser.
