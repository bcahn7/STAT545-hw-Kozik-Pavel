I initially created the repository on github and began working on it there. 

In the follow up class R markdown was introduced and I from there made all changes and progress via R. Initially it was slightly confusing because I had never prior used R markdown. However, learning how to edit both from R and in browser seemed to be worthwhile. 


Something not included in the sample assignment was how to center text and images. This was something I experimented with until eventually finding a satisfactory solution.

This final  portion of the assignment was written via browser.
